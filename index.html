            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Smart card microprocessors or memory chips exchange data with card readers and other systems 
                over a serial interface. The smart card itself is powered by an external source, usually the smart card reader.
                
                Smart cards communicate with readers via direct physical contact or using RFID or another short-range
                 wireless connectivity standard. The chip or processor on the card contains data that the card reader
                  accesses. The processor on the card contains a basic operating system (OS) that lets the card hold,
                   transmit and protect the data.
                
                The card reader passes data from the smart card to its intended destination, usually a payment or
                 authentication system, over a network connection.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                A smart card is a physical card that has an embedded integrated chip that acts as a security token. Smart 
                cards are typically the same size as a driver's license or credit card and can be made out of metal or plastic.
                 They connect to a reader either by direct physical contact -- also known as chip and dip -- or through a short-range 
                wireless connectivity standard such as radio-frequency identification (RFID) or near-field communication.
                
                The chip on a smart card can be either a microcontroller or an embedded memory chip. Smart cards are designed
                 to be tamper-resistant and use encryption to provide protection for in-memory information. Cards with microcontroller
                  chips can perform on-card processing functions and manipulate information in the chip's memory.
                
                Smart cards are used for a variety of applications but are most commonly used as credit cards and other payment cards.
                 The payment card industry's support of smart cards for the Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) card standard has drive
                 n the distribution of smart cards. Smart cards capable of short-range wireless connectivity can be used for contactless
                  payment systems. They can also be used as tokens for multifactor authentication (MFA).
